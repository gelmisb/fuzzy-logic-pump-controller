## Assignment 1 for Computer Intelligence for Stephen Sheridan

### Computational Intelligence Assignment 1 - 20%

**Description**
*Your goal for this assignment is to design and implement a Fuzzy Logic pump controller for the
feedback system shown below.*
Your fuzzy logic pump controller must control the bidirectional pump shown in the diagram above
in order to keep the level in the water tank between 40% and 70% full. The level in the water tank
is effected by a demand for water from appliances further down the line and its level can also be
effected by rainfall. The appliances further down the line can consume water from the tank and
can also feed water bank into the tank.
You should use the following input and output variables as part of your design:
Each variable should be broken down into the appropriate terms and membership functions but
that part of the fuzzy logic design along with the inference rules are left up to you.
Deliverables
You should create a design document that details your decisions with regard to the creation of
linguistic variables, and rules terms. Your document should include diagrams for each linguistic
variable showing how each term is setup. You should also create a rule matrix and translate it into
rules for your system.
Your fuzzy logic controller should be able to maintain the level in the water tank so that the green
light remains on. You should use the pump, rain, and demand checkboxes to ensure your system
works under all conditions. You will need to submit a single zipped file containing your design
document and the java source code.
